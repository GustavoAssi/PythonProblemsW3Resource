Long ago, in the age of heroes, there lived a young man named Perseus.
He was the son of Danaë, a mortal princess, and Zeus, king of the gods.
Perseus grew up brave, but his destiny was shaped by forces beyond his control.

King Polydectes, ruler of the island of Seriphos, desired Danaë.
To rid himself of her protective son, he devised a cruel challenge.
He demanded that Perseus bring him the head of Medusa, the Gorgon.

Medusa was no ordinary foe.
Her hair was a nest of living serpents.
Her gaze could turn any man to stone.
She dwelled in a desolate land, surrounded by statues of her victims.

Perseus prayed to the gods for aid.
Athena, goddess of wisdom, gave him a polished bronze shield.
Hermes, messenger of the gods, lent him winged sandals.
Hades, lord of the underworld, provided a helm of invisibility.
And Hephaestus, the smith, gave him a sharp sword.

Armed with divine gifts, Perseus set out on his perilous quest.
He flew across seas and mountains, guided by Hermes.
At last, he reached the lair of the Gorgons.
Two sisters slept nearby, but Medusa stirred restlessly.

Perseus dared not look directly at her.
He raised Athena’s shield, shining like a mirror.
Through its reflection, he saw the monstrous face.
The snakes hissed, the ground trembled, but Perseus stood firm.

With a swift stroke of his sword, he severed Medusa’s head.
From her blood sprang Pegasus, the winged horse, and Chrysaor, a warrior.
Perseus placed the head in a special bag, careful not to meet its deadly eyes.

The Gorgon sisters awoke, shrieking in fury.
But Perseus donned the helm of invisibility and escaped unseen.
He soared away on Hermes’ sandals, carrying his prize.

On his journey home, Perseus encountered new trials.
He found Andromeda chained to a rock, offered to a sea monster.
With Medusa’s head, he turned the beast to stone and freed her.
Andromeda became his beloved, his companion in triumph.

At last, Perseus returned to Seriphos.
Polydectes mocked him, refusing to believe his tale.
Perseus unveiled the Gorgon’s head.
The king and his court were instantly petrified.

Justice was served, and Danaë was safe.
Perseus laid the head upon Athena’s shield, where it remained forever.
Thus ended the tale of Perseus, the hero favored by the gods.
